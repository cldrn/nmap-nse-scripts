Attempts to discover DICOM servers (DICOM Service Provider) through a partial C-ECHO request.

C-ECHO requests are commonly known as DICOM ping as they are used to test connectivity.
Normally, a 'DICOM ping' is formed as follows:
* Client -> A-ASSOCIATE request -> Server
* Server -> A-ASSOCIATE ACCEPT/REJECT -> Client
* Client -> C-ECHO request -> Server
* Server -> C-ECHO response -> Client
* Client -> A-RELEASE request -> Server
* Server -> A-RELEASE response -> Client

For this script we only send the A-ASSOCIATE request and look for the success code in the response as it seems to be a reliable way of detecting the devices.
