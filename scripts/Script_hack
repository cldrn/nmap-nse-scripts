I'll walk you through a few examples of using NSE scripts.
The first will show running the smb-enum-shares.nse script. 
This script connects to a Windows or Samba file server and enumerates the shares. 
The syntax is:

nmap -Pn --script=smb-enum-shares 192.168.1.136



 You can see there are four shares: 
 ADMIN$, C$, IPC$, and "Documents and Settings". 
 Another simple script is http-headers which does exactly what it says, 
 retrieves HTTP headers. 
 Here is the syntax:
 
nmap -Pn -p80 --script=http-headers slashdot.org

 Those are some pretty simple examples. 
 Here is a little more complex one using smb-check-vulns.
 
 
nmap -Pn -p445 --script=smb-check-vulns 192.168.1.136
